# University Projects

A curated collection of key university projects I worked on during my studies.

## Highlights
- ✅ **Cloud Technologies** — complete and working
- ✅ **PSBM (Software Systems for Business Modeling)** — complete and working
- ⚠️ **Bachelor Diploma Project** — partially completed (core functionality implemented)
- ⚠️ **Software Engineering Project** — partially completed (presented with teammates; future improvements planned)

## Tech Stack (across projects)
- **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap
- **Back-end:** PHP
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Other:** AJAX (dynamic loading without full page refresh)

## Bachelor Diploma Project — Overview
A web application built as my Bachelor’s diploma project. The main focus was functionality and core features.

### Key Features
- Category/subcategory navigation and product listing powered by **PHP + MySQL**
- Dynamic page updates for selected categories using **AJAX + JavaScript + PHP** (no full browser reload)
- Product details view implemented with **JavaScript + PHP + MySQL**
- UI interactions and visual effects using **Bootstrap + CSS + jQuery**
- User authentication: **registration, login, logout** with **PHP + MySQL**

### Notes
- Some functionality is fully demonstrated only in the **Movies** category because sample data for other categories was not added.
- A public live demo is not available at the moment, as the project requires hosting and a database server.

## Other Web Applications
Smaller projects using fewer technologies (mainly **JavaScript** and some **Bootstrap**, plus HTML/CSS).  
Responsive behavior may be incomplete in some cases.

## Software Engineering Project
An unfinished project due to time constraints. The concept needs further development, and I plan to complete and improve it in the future.
